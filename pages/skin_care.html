          <p>
            Proper aftercare is essential to maintain smooth, healthy skin and
            get the best results from your waxing treatment. Please follow these

        <h2 class="section_title">
          Immediately After Your Wax (First 24 Hours)
        </h2>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What TO DO:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Apply a soothing product:</strong> Use aloe vera gel or a
          post-wax lotion to calm and hydrate your skin. These products help
          reduce redness and provide a cooling sensation.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Keep the area clean:</strong> Gently cleanse the waxed area
          with a mild, fragrance-free cleanser and lukewarm water. Pat dry with
          a clean towel.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Use a cool compress:</strong> If you experience discomfort,
          apply a cool compress or ice pack wrapped in a clean cloth for 10-15
          minutes to reduce inflammation and soothe the skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Wear loose, comfortable clothing:</strong> Choose breathable,
          cotton fabrics that won't rub against or irritate your freshly waxed
          skin. Avoid tight-fitting clothes, especially for bikini or Brazilian
          waxes.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What NOT to do:</h3>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>Avoid These for 24-48 Hours:</h3>
          <ul class="dont_list">
            <li>
              <strong>No hot water:</strong> Avoid hot showers, baths, hot tubs,
              saunas, and steam rooms. Heat can increase irritation and open
              pores, leading to potential infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No sun exposure or tanning:</strong> Your skin is extra
              sensitive after waxing. Stay out of direct sunlight and avoid
              tanning beds. If you must go outside, apply a broad-spectrum
              sunscreen.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No swimming:</strong> Avoid pools, oceans, lakes, and hot
              tubs. Chlorine, salt water, and bacteria can irritate freshly
              waxed skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No exercise or sweating:</strong> Skip the gym, cardio
              workouts, and any activities that cause excessive sweating. Sweat
              can irritate the area and clog newly opened pores.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No touching:</strong> Keep your hands away from the waxed
              area to prevent introducing bacteria and oils that could cause
              breakouts or infection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No makeup or heavy products:</strong> For facial waxing
              (brows, upper lip), avoid applying makeup, self-tanners, tinted
              moisturizers, or products with harsh chemicals or fragrances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No exfoliating products:</strong> Your skin has already
              been exfoliated by the waxing process. Avoid scrubs, loofahs, or
              harsh cleansers for the first 24-48 hours.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- DAYS 2-7 -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Days 2-7 After Your Wax</h2>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Begin gentle exfoliation (after 48 hours):</strong> Starting
          2-3 days after your wax, gently exfoliate the waxed area 2-3 times per
          week. This helps prevent ingrown hairs by removing dead skin cells and
          allowing hair to grow freely. Use a gentle sugar scrub or exfoliating
          mitt designed for sensitive skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Moisturize daily:</strong> Keep your skin hydrated by applying
          a lightweight, oil-free, fragrance-free moisturizer every day.
          Well-moisturized skin is less prone to irritation and ingrown hairs.
          Avoid heavy oils or products that can clog pores.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water to help your
          skin heal and maintain smoothness from the inside out.
        </div>

        <!-- ONGOING CARE -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Ongoing Care Between Waxing Appointments</h2>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Maintain your exfoliation routine:</strong> Continue
          exfoliating 2-3 times per week to prevent ingrown hairs and keep skin
          smooth.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Keep moisturizing:</strong> Daily moisturization is key to
          maintaining healthy, smooth skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Don't tweeze between appointments:</strong> Resist the urge to
          pluck stray hairs! Tweezing disrupts the hair growth cycle and can
          lead to uneven results at your next waxing appointment.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Schedule regular appointments:</strong> For best results, wax
          every 3-4 weeks. Consistent waxing makes hair grow back softer, finer,
          and less dense over time, making each treatment more comfortable.
        </div>

        <!-- TIPS BOX -->
        <div class="tip_box">
          <h3>Pro Tips for Best Results:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your third wax is typically your best wax! Hair growth cycles even
              out, making the experience more comfortable.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow hair to grow for 3-4 weeks between waxing appointments for
              optimal results.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you experience any unusual redness, swelling, or signs of
              infection that don't subside within 24 hours, please contact us or
              consult your healthcare provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural, cotton-based fabrics are your best friend after waxing!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Special Considerations</h2>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>For facial waxing (brows, upper lip):</strong> Be especially
          gentle with your skin. Avoid touching the area with your fingers,
          which can introduce oil and impurities. Wait at least 24 hours before
          applying makeup or using active skincare ingredients like retinoids or
          exfoliating acids.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>For bikini and Brazilian waxes:</strong> Wear fresh,
          breathable cotton underwear. Change out of wet bathing suits promptly.
          The area may feel more sensitive for the first treatment, but
          sensitivity typically decreases with regular waxing.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>For body waxing (legs, arms, back, chest):</strong> Wear loose
          clothing immediately after treatment. Avoid abrasive materials that
          might irritate the skin.
        </div>
