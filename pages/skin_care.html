            Proper aftercare is essential to maintain smooth, healthy skin and

        <!-- SECTION 1: IMMEDIATELY AFTER (FIRST 24 HOURS) -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Immediately After Your Wax (First 24 Hours)</h2>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What TO DO:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Apply a soothing product:</strong> Use aloe vera gel or a post-wax lotion to calm and hydrate your skin. These products help reduce redness and provide a cooling sensation.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Keep the area clean:</strong> Gently cleanse the waxed area with a mild, fragrance-free cleanser and lukewarm water. Pat dry with a clean towel.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Use a cool compress:</strong> If you experience discomfort, apply a cool compress or ice pack wrapped in a clean cloth for 10-15 minutes to reduce inflammation and soothe the skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Wear loose, comfortable clothing:</strong> Choose breathable, cotton fabrics that won't rub against or irritate your freshly waxed skin. Avoid tight-fitting clothes, especially for bikini or Brazilian waxes.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What NOT to do:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No hot water:</strong> Avoid hot showers, baths, hot tubs, saunas, and steam rooms. Heat can increase irritation and open pores, leading to potential infection.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No sun exposure or tanning:</strong> Your skin is extra sensitive after waxing. Stay out of direct sunlight and avoid tanning beds. If you must go outside, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No swimming:</strong> Avoid pools, oceans, lakes, and hot tubs. Chlorine, salt water, and bacteria can irritate freshly waxed skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No exercise or sweating:</strong> Skip the gym, cardio workouts, and any activities that cause excessive sweating. Sweat can irritate the area and clog newly opened pores.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No touching:</strong> Keep your hands away from the waxed area to prevent introducing bacteria and oils that could cause breakouts or infection.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No makeup or heavy products:</strong> For facial waxing (brows, upper lip), avoid applying makeup, self-tanners, tinted moisturizers, or products with harsh chemicals or fragrances.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No exfoliating products:</strong> Your skin has already been exfoliated by the waxing process. Avoid scrubs, loofahs, or harsh cleansers for the first 24-48 hours.
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: DAYS 2-7 AFTER YOUR WAX -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Days 2-7 After Your Wax</h2>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What TO DO:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Begin gentle exfoliation (after 48 hours):</strong> Starting 2-3 days after your wax, gently exfoliate the waxed area 2-3 times per week. This helps prevent ingrown hairs by removing dead skin cells and allowing hair to grow freely. Use a gentle sugar scrub or exfoliating mitt designed for sensitive skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Moisturize daily:</strong> Keep your skin hydrated by applying a lightweight, oil-free, fragrance-free moisturizer every day. Well-moisturized skin is less prone to irritation and ingrown hairs. Avoid heavy oils or products that can clog pores.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water to help your skin heal and maintain smoothness from the inside out.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What NOT to do:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No harsh products:</strong> Continue to avoid products with harsh chemicals, fragrances, or active ingredients like retinoids or acids until your skin has fully healed.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>No picking or scratching:</strong> If you experience any bumps or irritation, do not pick at them. This can lead to scarring or infection.
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: ONGOING CARE BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Ongoing Care Between Waxing Appointments</h2>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What TO DO:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Maintain your exfoliation routine:</strong> Continue exfoliating 2-3 times per week to prevent ingrown hairs and keep skin smooth.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Keep moisturizing:</strong> Daily moisturization is key to maintaining healthy, smooth skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Schedule regular appointments:</strong> For best results, wax every 3-4 weeks. Consistent waxing makes hair grow back softer, finer, and less dense over time, making each treatment more comfortable.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">What NOT to do:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Don't tweeze between appointments:</strong> Resist the urge to pluck stray hairs! Tweezing disrupts the hair growth cycle and can lead to uneven results at your next waxing appointment.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Don't shave:</strong> Shaving will disrupt your waxing results and cause hair to grow back thicker and coarser. Stick to waxing for the smoothest, longest-lasting results.
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 4: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Special Considerations</h2>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">For Facial Waxing (Brows, Upper Lip):</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Be especially gentle:</strong> Avoid touching the area with your fingers, which can introduce oil and impurities. Wait at least 24 hours before applying makeup or using active skincare ingredients like retinoids or exfoliating acids.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">For Bikini and Brazilian Waxes:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Wear fresh, breathable underwear:</strong> Choose cotton fabrics and change out of wet bathing suits promptly. The area may feel more sensitive for the first treatment, but sensitivity typically decreases with regular waxing.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">For Body Waxing (Legs, Arms, Back, Chest):</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Wear loose clothing:</strong> Avoid abrasive materials that might irritate the skin immediately after treatment.
        </div>
