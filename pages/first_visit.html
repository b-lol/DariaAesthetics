        <div class="intro_text">
          <p><strong>Welcome to Daria Aesthetics!</strong></p>
          <p>
            We're excited to guide you through your first waxing appointment.
            While it's natural to feel a bit nervous, proper preparation and
            knowing what to expect will help ensure a comfortable, positive
            experience. This guide will walk you through everything you need to
            know!
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- BEFORE YOUR APPOINTMENT -->
        <h2 class="section_title">How to Prepare Before Your Appointment</h2>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">Hair Length Requirements:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Stop shaving 2-3 weeks before your appointment:</strong> Your
          hair needs to be at least ¼ inch long (about the size of a grain of
          rice) for the wax to grip properly. If hair is too short, it cannot be
          removed effectively. If you haven't shaved in a while and hair is
          longer than ½ inch, you can carefully trim it down, but don't go too
          short!
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Avoid tweezing or plucking:</strong> Only shaving should be
          stopped before waxing. Don't tweeze, thread, or use other hair removal
          methods that remove hair from the root, as this disrupts the growth
          cycle.
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">24-48 Hours Before:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Gently exfoliate the area:</strong> Use a mild scrub or
          exfoliating glove to remove dead skin cells. This helps the wax adhere
          better and allows for a cleaner removal. Don't over-exfoliate or
          irritate the skin.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Moisturize your skin:</strong> Keep your skin hydrated with a
          light, oil-free moisturizer. Well-hydrated skin experiences less
          discomfort during waxing. However, avoid heavy creams or oils that can
          create a barrier.
        </div>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>Important Medication Information:</h3>
          <p>
            If you're using any of the following products, please inform us
            before your appointment:
          </p>
          <ul class="dont_list">
            <li>
              <strong>Retinol, Retin-A, or Accutane:</strong> These products
              increase cell turnover and thin the skin, which can lead to skin
              lifting or tearing during waxing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Other prescription topicals:</strong> Certain medications
              can make your skin more sensitive.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blood thinners or aspirin:</strong> These can increase
              sensitivity and bruising.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please let us know about any skin sensitivities, allergies, or
            medical conditions during your consultation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="timeline_header">Day of Your Appointment:</h3>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Shower and cleanse thoroughly:</strong> Make sure the area to
          be waxed is clean and free of oils, lotions, sweat, makeup, or
          deodorant. Clean skin is essential for effective waxing and hygiene.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Skip the lotions and oils:</strong> Don't apply any products
          to the area that will be waxed on the day of your appointment. These
          create a barrier that prevents the wax from adhering properly.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Wear loose, comfortable clothing:</strong> Choose breathable,
          loose-fitting clothes made from natural fibers like cotton. This is
          especially important for bikini, Brazilian, or underarm waxing. Your
          skin will be sensitive after the treatment, and tight clothing can
          cause irritation.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Consider taking a pain reliever:</strong> If you're concerned
          about discomfort, you may take an over-the-counter pain reliever (like
          Tylenol or Ibuprofen) about 30-60 minutes before your appointment.
          However, avoid aspirin as it can thin the blood.
        </div>

        <div class="tip_box">
          <h3>Timing Your Appointment:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Avoid scheduling during your menstrual cycle:</strong>
              Your skin is more sensitive during this time, which can increase
              discomfort. Try to schedule your appointment between cycles if
              possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan ahead for special events:</strong> If you're waxing
              for a vacation, wedding, or special occasion, schedule your
              appointment 2-3 days in advance. This gives any redness or
              irritation time to subside.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- WHAT TO EXPECT -->
        <h2 class="section_title">What to Expect During Your Appointment</h2>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Warm welcome and consultation:</strong> When you arrive, we'll
          greet you and guide you to a private treatment room. We'll discuss
          your preferences, any concerns you have, your skin type, and review
          your medical history. Feel free to ask any questions! Communication is
          key to ensuring your comfort.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Privacy and comfort:</strong> Depending on the area being
          waxed, you may need to partially undress. We provide complete privacy
          and will ensure you feel comfortable throughout the process. For
          bikini and Brazilian waxes, you'll undress from the waist down. We
          remain professional and focused on providing the best service.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Skin preparation:</strong> We'll cleanse the area to remove
          any remaining oils, lotions, or debris. For certain waxing methods, we
          may apply a pre-wax oil or powder to protect your skin and ensure
          optimal results.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>The waxing process:</strong> Wax is applied in small sections
          and then quickly removed, pulling hair from the root. We work
          efficiently to minimize discomfort while ensuring thorough hair
          removal. The process typically takes:
          <ul>
            <li>Small areas (brows, upper lip): 5-10 minutes</li>
            <li>Medium areas (underarms, bikini): 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Large areas (legs, Brazilian): 30-60 minutes</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Post-treatment care:</strong> After waxing, we'll apply a
          soothing product to calm your skin and reduce any redness. We'll also
          provide personalized aftercare instructions and answer any questions
          you have.
        </div>

        <!-- PAIN AND COMFORT -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Managing Discomfort</h2>

        <div class="intro_text">
          <p>
            Let's be honest: waxing can be uncomfortable, especially the first
            time. However, most clients find it's much more manageable than they
            expected. Here's what you should know:
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>It gets easier:</strong> Your first wax may be the most
          uncomfortable because hair is thicker and the follicles are stronger.
          With regular waxing (every 3-4 weeks), hair grows back softer, finer,
          and less dense, making each subsequent appointment more comfortable.
          Many clients report that their third wax is significantly easier!
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Everyone's tolerance is different:</strong> Pain is
          subjective. What feels uncomfortable to one person may be barely
          noticeable to another. We work at a pace that's comfortable for you
          and can take breaks if needed.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Breathing helps:</strong> Deep, slow breathing can
          significantly reduce discomfort. Try to relax your muscles rather than
          tensing up, which can make things more painful.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Communication is key:</strong> If you're feeling too much
          discomfort, let us know! We can adjust our technique, take breaks, or
          provide additional comfort measures.
        </div>

        <!-- AFTER YOUR FIRST WAX -->
        <h2 class="section_title">After Your First Wax</h2>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Expect some redness and sensitivity:</strong> It's completely
          normal to experience pinkness, slight swelling, or sensitivity for a
          few hours after your first wax. This should subside within 24 hours.
          If redness persists beyond 24 hours or you notice unusual reactions,
          please contact us.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Follow aftercare instructions:</strong> Proper aftercare is
          essential! Avoid heat, sun, swimming, exercise, and touching the area
          for 24-48 hours. Apply soothing products like aloe vera gel. For
          complete aftercare instructions, please visit our
          <a
            href="/pages/waxing_aftercare.html"
            style="color: var(--primary-pink); text-decoration: underline"
            >Waxing Aftercare Page</a
          >.
        </div>

        <div class="instruction_box">
          <strong>Schedule your next appointment:</strong> For best results and
          to maintain smooth skin, plan to return every 3-4 weeks. Regular
          waxing keeps your hair growth cycle synchronized and makes the process
          progressively more comfortable.
        </div>

        <!-- COMMON CONCERNS -->
        <h2 class="section_title">Common First-Timer Questions</h2>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>Will it hurt?</h3>
          <p>
            The level of discomfort varies by individual and the area being
            waxed. Most people find the anticipation worse than the actual
            experience. The first wax may be more uncomfortable, but it becomes
            easier with regular appointments as hair grows back finer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>How long will the results last?</h3>
          <p>
            Waxing results typically last 3-6 weeks, depending on your
            individual hair growth cycle. Hair grows back softer and finer than
            when you shave.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>Will I get ingrown hairs?</h3>
          <p>
            Ingrown hairs can occur, but proper exfoliation and moisturizing
            between appointments significantly reduces this risk. We'll provide
            you with tips to prevent ingrown hairs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>What if I have sensitive skin?</h3>
          <p>
            Please inform us about any skin sensitivities during your
            consultation. We can recommend specific products and techniques for
            sensitive skin and will perform a patch test if needed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>Can I wax during my period?</h3>
          <p>
            While it's possible, we recommend scheduling your appointment
            between cycles when your skin is less sensitive. If you must wax
            during your period (for bikini/Brazilian services), please wear a
            fresh tampon or menstrual cup.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="warning_box">
          <h3>What if my hair is uneven?</h3>
          <p>
            It's completely normal for hair growth to be uneven during your
            first wax, especially if you've been shaving. The growth will even
            out after 2-3 consistent waxing appointments.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- FINAL TIPS -->
        <div class="tip_box">
          <h3>Tips for the Best First Experience:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water before and after your
              appointment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to relax! Anxiety can heighten discomfort. Listen to music,
              practice deep breathing, or chat with your esthetician.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't judge waxing by your first experience. Give it 2-3 sessions
              before deciding if it's right for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trust the professionals. We've performed thousands of waxing
              services and will guide you through the process with care and
              expertise.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reward yourself afterward! Treat yourself to something nice after
              your appointment.
            </li>
